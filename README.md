This repo contains open source material for Algorithmic Foundations of Data Science.

The lecture plans is as follows: 

1-) Linear Algebra + Linear Algorithms -- QR, Cholesky, PCA, Linear Regression -- 

2-) Numerical Analysis, Conditioning, Stability

3-) Basics of Probability, Cross-Entropy distance, Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression

4-) Multivariate Probability, Convolutiions, CLT, Gaussian-Gaussian, PPCA, MLE. EM algorithm

5-) Basics of Decision Theory and Other Generalities (like Bias-Variance trade-off)

6-) Basics of Differentiable Programming

7-) Convolutional NNets

8-) NNets with memory: RNN, LTSM, Transformers, SSM

9-) Conexity Basics and Gradient Descent

10-) Stochastic, Accelerated, and Preconditioned Gradient Descent --- AdaGrad, Ada-Delta, RMSProp, ADAM --

11-) Convex Constrained Gradient Descent, Coordinate Descent -- Projected Gradient Descent, Frank-Wolfe, Graphical LASSO --

12-) Duality, KKT, Non-smooth Optimization -- Subgradient Methods, Proximal Point Method, Bundle Methods --

13-) Markov Chains and MCMC --- Metropolis-Hastings, Gibbs --

14-) Concentration Inequalities (Chernoff, Hoefding),  Morris++, Hashing, Bloom Filters

15-) Limear Sketching, Johnson-Lindenstrauss

16-) Autoencoders, Manifold Learning

17-) Classical ML, Kernel Methods

18-) Trees, Forests, Bagging, Boosting

We also had industry speakers on:  (1) Causal Inference, (2) Time-Series Analysis, (3) Reinforcement Learning, (4) Generative AI, (5) Recommendation and Search


Any feedback on lecture plans is welcome.


Some of the lectures are available here in the repo, and some others are planned to be available in future.
I did not have time scrutinize the notes, so take it with your own risk.

We have wonderful notebooks prepped by Farhan Tajwar Romit on  Matrix decompositions, PCA, PPCA,  Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,  Basics of Neural Nets - Backprop (after Karpathy).

Planned notebooks for future are: Why momentum works? and XGBoost/CatBoost.
